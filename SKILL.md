# Read text aloud

Convert the user's exact text into speech, download the resulting MP3, and make
that local file playable in the host application. Do not rewrite, correct,
translate, summarize, or otherwise change the text unless the user separately
asks for that transformation before synthesis.

## Require explicit approval

Before every synthesis, tell the user that:

- the text will be sent over HTTPS to the VoiceFlow API at
  `https://asr.audioflow123.com` and to VoiceFlow's Alibaba Cloud TTS provider;
- the VoiceFlow token is sent only to the VoiceFlow API, never to the
  provider-issued signed audio URL;
- the generated MP3 will be downloaded from that signed HTTPS URL to a private
  local temporary file; and
- VoiceFlow charges `$0.70 per 10,000` provider-reported billable characters.

Ask a direct yes-or-no question. A request to read text aloud describes the
desired result but is not approval for remote processing or billing. Do not run
the synthesis command unless the user explicitly agrees for that request.

## Connect to VoiceFlow

Resolve the directory containing this `SKILL.md` as `{baseDir}`. Check the
connection without printing the full token:

```bash
node "{baseDir}/scripts/auth.mjs" status
```

If the result is `not_connected`, begin browser authorization:

```bash
node "{baseDir}/scripts/auth.mjs" begin
```

Show `verification_uri_complete` and `user_code` unchanged. Only the user may
sign in, register, and approve in the browser. Never request or handle an email
password, payment credential, or full API token. After the user confirms
approval, run:

```bash
node "{baseDir}/scripts/auth.mjs" wait
```

The full `vf_stt_` token is generated and stored locally with private
permissions. An existing `VOICEFLOW_TOKEN` environment variable takes
precedence. Never echo or log the token, place it in command arguments, or write
it to the repository. For an invalid token, start authorization again. For
revocation or prepaid balance, direct the user to the
[VoiceFlow dashboard](https://audioflow123.com/dashboard).

## Synthesize

Accept exact plain text that is non-empty after trimming and no longer than
4,096 Unicode characters. The optional speed is `0.5` through `2.0`, defaulting
to `1.0`. Do not send model, language, voice, format, or sample-rate overrides.
The server selects Chinese and English voices automatically and returns MP3.

Pass the text through standard input so it is not exposed in process arguments:

```bash
node "{baseDir}/scripts/read-aloud.mjs" [--speed 1.0]
```

Start the process first, then write the exact text to its standard input. Do not
interpolate untrusted text into a shell command. Use `--output
/absolute/path/file.mp3` only when the user explicitly requests a persistent
file; the command refuses to overwrite an existing file.

The TTS POST is intentionally attempted once. Never retry it automatically,
because an uncertain response may already have incurred provider cost.

## Play the result

On success, the command prints JSON containing only the private local MP3 path,
format, language category, selected voice, billed character count, and expiry.
It never prints the provider URL or its signed query parameters.

Use the host application's audio attachment or media rendering capability to
play the returned absolute MP3 path. If the host cannot render audio, provide
the local path and say that it is an MP3; do not install a player or open another
application without explicit approval.

Report the selected language, voice, and billed characters briefly. Keep the
temporary MP3 available long enough for playback. Do not copy it elsewhere,
upload it, or retain the input text separately unless the user asks.

## Failure handling

- `401 invalid_api_key`: reconnect through `auth.mjs begin`.
- `402`: explain that prepaid balance or the API-key spending limit is
  insufficient and link the dashboard.
- `429`: report the active concurrency or rate limit; do not retry silently.
- `502`, `503`, or `504`: report that synthesis is temporarily unavailable; do
  not retry unless the user explicitly requests a new attempt.
- Unsupported writing systems or invalid input: return the API error without
  changing or translating the text.

Never include the input text, token, provider URL, or signed query parameters in
diagnostics.

## Version

Version 1.0.0: synthesize approved text through VoiceFlow TTS and return a
private, playable MP3 with automatic Chinese or English voice routing.
